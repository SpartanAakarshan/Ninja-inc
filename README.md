## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and configure the build settings
6. Click "Deploy"

The site will be deployed and you'll get a URL where it's live.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for the basic setup. If you want to add email functionality or a database later, you'll need to add the appropriate environment variables in your Vercel project settings.
